# Fly-By-Data

The Script folder contains preprocess.py and main script.py.

The script folder contains preprocess.py, which will process the raw sensor files and remove unwanted columns.

Main script.py takes the cleaned sensor file, log mat files, and an Excel sheet containing names of the files as input and gives the Wind profile graph.

Instructions to run the main script.py

- Download the "log matlab files" and "Processed sensor files" folder.
- Append their path in 'log_path' and 'sen_path' respectively in the code.
- Download the Excel file from the drive named "Rajali_oct25" and append its path to "excel_file".
- Also, change the path to the main libraries folder at the top of the code.
- User input - Enter the number of flights to be displayed in the form "15-20" for multiple files and "5" for a single file.
